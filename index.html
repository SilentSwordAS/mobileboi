								from the inside. Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot

								Marking exactly 100 years since the publication of Agatha Christie's first novel, this
								new
								edition includes a previously deleted chapter and a newly discovered essay, 'Drugs and
								Detective Stories', in which Agatha Christie reminisces about the inspiration for
								Poirot's
								first case. 'Beware! Peril to the detective who says: "It is so small - it does not
								matter..." Everything matters.' After the Great War, life can never be the same again.
								Wounds need healing, and the horror of violent death banished into memory. Captain
								Arthur
								Hastings is invited to the rolling country estate of Styles to recuperate from injuries
								sustained at the Front. It is the last place he expects to encounter murder.
